    <P>
        E-learning requires self-discipline and self-motivation in order to be successful. Because the learner is fully in charge of his or her own progress, they will literally get out of the learning what they put in.
        In the case of schools, e-learning will usually be overseen by a teacher, parent or leader, who can ensure students are committing to the process and getting the best results. 
        But even then, particularly in the case of remote learning,
         it still requires an element of self discipline from the students themselves
