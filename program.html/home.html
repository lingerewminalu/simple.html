        <h1> BENEFITS OF E-LEARNING</h1>
        <h2>AFFORDABLE AND TIME-SAVING</h2>
        <p>Because e-learning can accessed from pretty much anywhere – including your own home – it removes travel costs, printed materials, and the costs associated with running an office or learning institute.

            This means not only can online learning save everybody time, it also makes learning much more affordable for the learners.
        </p>
        <h2>LEARNERS CAN STUDY ANYWHERE, ANYTIME</h2>
        <p>E-learning can be accessed from pretty much any device these days, meaning learning doesn’t have to be saved just for the classroom or even the home.

            Apps and online learning platforms enable learners to continue the learning process when its convenient for them  – including on the go – meaning they can make greater strides with their learning.</p>

    <h1>DISADVANTAGES OF E-LEARNING</h1>
    <h2>REQUIRES SELF-MOTIVATION</h2>
    <p>E-learning requires self-discipline and self-motivation in order to be successful. Because the learner is fully in charge of his or her own progress, they will literally get out of the learning what they put in.

        In the case of schools, e-learning will usually be overseen by a teacher, parent or leader, who can ensure students are committing to the process and getting the best results. But even then, particularly in the case of remote learning, it still requires an element of self discipline from the students themselves.</p>
        <h2>DOESN’T PROVIDE PRACTICAL TRAINING</h2>
        <p>E-learning can provide the theory aspect of a training exercise, but cannot provide practical training, which may be needed in some subjects to ensure competency. This would be an example of blended learning, which allows you to use e-learning alongside traditional face-to-face training.</p>
