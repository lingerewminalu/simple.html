    HTML
     1.HTML is an SGML-based language. 
    That is, it defines the standard for generalizing the markup languages for documents. 
    2.SGML stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language.
     3.HTML is not a case-sensitive language.
    4. HTML empty elements do not require a closing tag at the end, not even a "/" symbol to signify the end of the tag.
    5. The tags and attributes in HTML can be specified either in lowercase or uppercase since it is not case-sensitive.
    6.The HTML document requires a minimum of four tags to create an HTML page that 
    XHTML
    1. XHTML is an XML-based language, which means it manipulates and processes data using XML technologies.
    2. XHTML is a case-sensitive language.3. XHTML empty elements must always be closed; that is, there must be a "/" symbol at the end of the empty element.
    5. All XHTML elements and attributes must be in lowercase since it is a case-sensitive language.
    
    
    1. HTML 1.0
    The basic version of HTML has support for basic elements like text controls and images. This was the very basic version of HTML with less support for a wide range of HTML elements. It does not have rich features like styling and other things that were related to how content will be rendered in a browser.
    The initial version of HTML does not provide support for tables, font support, etc., as it provides us in the latest version.
    We would also like to discuss that W3C did not exist before HTML 2.0; hence it does not show details about HTML 1.
    2. HTML 2
    HTML version 2.0 was developed in 1995 with basic intention of improving HTML version 1.0
    Now a standard got started to develop so as to maintain common rules and regulations across different browsers.
    HTML 2.0 has improved a lot in terms of the markup tags
    . In HTML 2.0 version concept of form came into force. Forms were developed, but still, they had basic tags like text boxes, buttons, etc.
    Also, the table came as an HTML tag. Now, in HTML tag 2.0, browsers also came with the concept of creating their own layers of tags that were specific to the browser itself.
     W3C was also formed. The main intention of W3C is to maintain standard across different web browsers so that these browsers understand and render HTML tags in a similar manner.
    3. HTML 3.2
    It was developed in 1997. After HTML 2.0 was developed, the next version of HTML was 3.2
    With version 3.2 of HTML, HTML tags were further improved.
     It is worth noting that because of W3C standard maintenance, the newer version of HTML was 3.2 instead of 3.
    Now, HTML 3.2 has better support for new form elements. 
    Another important feature what HTML 3.2 implemented was support for CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
     It is CSS that provides features to make HTML tags look better on rendering it on browsers. CSS helps to style HTML elements.
    With the upgradation of browsers to HTML 3.2, the browser also supported for frame tags, although HTML specifications still do not support frame markup tags.
    4. HTML 4.01
    It was developed in 1999. It extended the support of cascading styling sheets.
     In version 3.2, CSS were embedded in HTML page itself. Therefore, if the website has various web pages to apply to the style of each page, we must place CSS on each web page. Hence there was a repetition of the same block of CSS.
    To overcome this thing, in version 4.01 concept of an external styling sheet emerged. 
    Under this concept, an external CSS file could be developed, and this external styling file could be included in HTML itself. 
    HTML 4.01 provided support for further new tags of HTML.
    5. HTML5
    This is the latest version of HTML. For a developer, it could be used in 2014.
     It came up with lots of HTML tags support.
     HTML5 provided support for new form elements like input element s of different types; geolocations support tags, etc.
    version of html
    XHTML 1.1
    To this version, finalized in 2004, the OMA added partial support for the Scripting Module and partial support for Intrinsic Events. XHTML MP 1.1 is part of v2.1 of the OMA Browsing Specification (1 November 2002).[61]
    
    XHTML 1.2
    This version, finalized on 27 February 2007, expands the capabilities of XHTML MP 1.1 with full support for the Forms Module and OMA Text Input Modes. XHTML MP 1.2 is part of v2.3 of the OMA Browsing Specification (13 March 2007).[61]
    
    XHTML 1.3
    XHTML MP 1.3 (finalized on 23 September 2008) uses the XHTML Basic 1.1 document type definition, which includes the Target Module. Events in this version of the specification are updated to DOM Level 3 specifications (i.e., they are platform- and language-neutral).
    
    XHTML 1.2
    The XHTML 2 Working Group considered the creation of a new language based on XHTML 1.1.[62] If XHTML 1.2 was created, it would include WAI-ARIA and role attributes to better support accessible web applications, and improved Semantic Web support through RDFa. The inputmode attribute from XHTML Basic 1.1, along with the target attribute (for specifying frame targets) might also be present. The XHTML2 WG had not been chartered to carry out the development of XHTML1.2. Since the W3C announced that it does not intend to recharter the XHTML2 WG,[6] and closed the WG in December 2010, this means that XHTML 1.2 proposal would not eventuate.
    
    XHTML 2.0
    Between August 2002 and July 2006, the W3C released eight Working Drafts of XHTML 2.0, a new version of XHTML able to make a clean break from the past by discarding the requirement of backward compatibility. This lack of compatibility with XHTML 1.x and HTML 4 caused some early controversy in the web developer community.[63] Some parts of the language (such as the role and RDFa attributes) were subsequently split out of the specification and worked on as separate modules, partially to help make the transition from XHTML 1.x to XHTML 2.0 smoother. The ninth draft of XHTML 2.0 was expected to appear in 2009, but on 2 July 2009, the W3C decided to let the XHTML2 Working Group charter expire by that year's end, effectively halting any further development of the draft into a standard.[6] Instead, XHTML 2.0 and its related documents were released as W3C Notes in 2010.[64][65]
